title: Invite friends to Status
---

If some of your friends don't have Status profiles yet, you can invite them and help them find you in the app. Once they [download](./#download-status.md) and install Status, [share your profile with them](../your-profile-and-preferences/share-your-status-profile.md) and ask them to [add you to their contacts](../your-profile-and-preferences/add-a-contact-in-status.md).
