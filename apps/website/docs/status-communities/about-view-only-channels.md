:::info
Currently, you can only set up and manage view-only channels using Status desktop. [:octicons-desktop-download-16: Download Status desktop](https://status.im/get).
:::

[Channels](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.md) are spaces for conversation, discussion and information sharing. By default, all community members with access to a channel can read and send messages.

As a community [owner or admin](./permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.md), you can set a channel as view-only. To learn how to do that, check out [Set up a view-only channel](./set-up-a-view-only-channel.md).

A read-only channel helps maintain clear, uninterrupted communication for specific purposes. While members can't respond directly in these channels, they are crucial in keeping your community informed and engaged.

## View-only channel permission

When you [set up a channel permission](./set-up-channel-permissions.md), only members who meet the criteria for that permission can perform the associated action within that channel.

This is how the `View` and `View and post` channel permissions work in your community.

| Channel permission \\ Member | Members not meeting the criteria | Members meeting the criteria | Owner and admins     |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------- |
| None                         | :material-check-all:             | :material-check-all:         | :material-check-all: |
| `View`                       | :octicons-x-24:                  | :material-check:             | :material-check-all: |
| `View and post`              | :octicons-x-24:                  | :material-check-all:         | :material-check-all: |

(:material-check-all: view and post, :material-check: view only, :octicons-x-24: no access)

Members with view-only access to the channel can still [react](../messaging-and-web3-browser/react-and-reply-to-messages.md) to messages in the channel with emojis.

## Using a view-only channel

View-only channels can help keep your community organized and focused. Here are some ideas on how you can use view-only channels.

- **Community announcements and updates**

  To keep important announcements or updates clutter-free, use a view-only channel. Only community owners and admins can write in these channels, ensuring your message is delivered without distractions.

- **Information sharing**

  If there are specific resources or guidelines that members need to access regularly, a view-only channel is as a convenient and easy-to-find repository. For example, you can share information that new community members may find helpful.

- **Learning communities**

  In learning communities, view-only channels allow owners to share exercises and training materials while keeping the conversation focused.

- **Voting or pooling areas**

  Because members with view-only access can still [react](../messaging-and-web3-browser/react-and-reply-to-messages.md) to messages in view-only channels, owners can use them for voting on different topics or proposals.
