A [Status Community][about-status-communities] is a place where you can connect and communicate with people who share your interests. Communities are ideal for those with a passion or hobby, study groups, gaming communities, professional network groups, or creators looking to generate income from their content without intermediaries.

As a community owner, you can create open communities or [restrict community access using tokens][set-up-a-private-community], control [membership approval][set-up-your-community-s-approval-options] and organize discussion groups in [channels][create-a-channel]. Owners have complete control over their community and are responsible for maintaining its rules.

## Create a community

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-communities: **Communities**.
    1. On top of the content area, click **Create community**.
    1. Add a **name** and a **short description** of your community.
    1. Optionally, add a **logo**, **banner**, **colour** palette and **tags**. You can [customize these settings](#customize-your-community) at any time.

## Configure additional settings

You can configure these community settings:

| Setting                          | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community history service**    | Status Communities store up to 30 days of chat history by default. When this option is checked, community members can see messages older than 30 days.                |
| **Request to join required**     | Community owners must manually approve each join request if this setting is checked. This option applies to [open and private][about-status-communities] communities. |
| **Any member can pin a message** | Any community member can [pin messages][pin-a-message] when this setting is checked. If the setting is unchecked, only the community owner can pin messages.          |

:::info
The Community history service uses the [BitTorrent peer-to-peer network :octicons-tab-external-16:][bittorrent-peer-to-peer-network] to store and retrieve community messages older than 30 days. Status uses a decentralized network and does not store this information.
