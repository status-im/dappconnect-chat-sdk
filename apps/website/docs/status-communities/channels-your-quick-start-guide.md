title: 'Channels: your quick start guide'
---

In [Status Communities](./how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide.md), you have access to dedicated spaces called channels. Channels bring the right people and information together for any project or topic. A channel conversation focuses on specific topics, and you can [join](./join-a-channel.md) and [leave](./leave-a-channel.md) the conversation anytime.

As a community owner, you can use channels to break down a large community into smaller, more focused sub-groups. With Status, you can [configure channel permissions](./configure-channel-permissions.md) based on token ownership. For example, you can make a public channel private or view-only by only allowing holders of specific tokens to join or post.

:::tip
To add channels to your community, check out [Create a channel](./create-a-channel.md).

=== ":mobile-one: Community information"
Information about the community, such as the number of members, active users or the main community topics.

=== ":mobile-two: Channel categories"
Community owners can group related channels into [categories](./create-a-channel.md). This is especially useful for communities with a lot of channels.

=== ":mobile-three: Channels list"
The list of available channels in a community. [Private channels](./configure-channel-permissions.md) have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to the channel name.

## Public and private channels

All members in a [Status Community](./how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide.md) can browse and join public channels. For private channels, you must [meet the token requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md) to join the channel. To maintain access to private channels, hold the required tokens at all times.

:::info
Messages in [private communities](./how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide.md) and private channels are always end-to-end encrypted.

All community members can join public channels. When you join a community, you automatically get access to these channels.

=== ":mobile-two: Private channel"

## Channel information

=== ":mobile-one: Channel information"
You can see the channel name and permissions here. Private channels have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon. From this area, you can select :mobile-more-options: **More options** to view more details about the channel, such as channel members, permissions or notifications.

=== ":mobile-two: Pinned message area"
Channel members can [pin messages](../messaging-and-web3-browser/pin-a-message.md) to this area, such as announcements, FAQ or channel rules.

=== ":mobile-three: Channel feed"
This area shows the channel activity, including messages, photos, reactions or links.

=== ":mobile-four: Message field"
From here, you can send messages to channel members with [text](../messaging-and-web3-browser/send-and-read-messages.md), [images](../messaging-and-web3-browser/share-images-in-status.md) or emojis, as well as [audio messages](../messaging-and-web3-browser/send-an-audio-message.md).

## The #general channel

The #general channel is created by default when you [create a community](./create-a-status-community.md). You can use this channel for various purposes, including sharing news, discussing community policies and events or making announcements.

This channel works like any other channel. As a community administrator, here's how you can make this channel more helpful:

- Don't rename the channel. The #general channel is widely recognized and understood in communities. Renaming the channel may confuse members.
- [Set up permissions](./configure-channel-permissions.md) to restrict who can post in #general. This removes noise from the channel and keeps it on topic.
- Use the #general channel to [pin messages](../messaging-and-web3-browser/pin-a-message.md) describing FAQs, community rules or other information relevant to your community.
