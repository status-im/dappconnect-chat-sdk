title: Delete a channel
---

:::info
Currently, you can only delete a channel using Status desktop.
:::

Community owners can delete [channels](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.md) within their communities. As a community owner, when you delete a channel, all messages and files associated with that channel are also deleted.

:::info
Once you delete a channel, it can't be retrieved or restored.
:::

## What to expect

- You can only delete a channel if you are the community owner.

- When you delete a channel, it disappears immediately, and all users lose access to its content (messages and files).

- If you delete a private channel, the [permissions](./configure-channel-permissions.md) you configured for the channel are also lost. If you want to recreate the channel, you need to configure its permissions again.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community with the channel you want to delete.
    1. In the **Community** sidebar, right-click the channel.
    1. Select :desktop-delete: **Delete Channel**.
    1. In the **Delete** pop-up window, click **Delete**.
