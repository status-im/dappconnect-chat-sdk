title: Leave a Status Community
---

There are times when you may not enjoy the conversations in a community, and you can leave it.

:::tip
If you find yourself overwhelmed by community notifications, there's no need to leave the communities. You can [turn off the notifications][configure-community-and-channel-notifications].

## What to expect

- When you leave a community, you stop receiving messages or updates from that community.
- Status does not notify the community owner and other members when you leave.
- You can request to join the community again. Depending on the community rules, rejoining might require a new approval process or specific tokens.
