title: Mute your notifications
---

You can turn off and on your notifications for the entire app or specific communities, channels, group chats, and direct messages (DMs) for a designated period. Communities, group chats, channels and direct messages appear greyed out when you mute their notifications.

:::tip
You have the option to [set notification exceptions](./set-notification-exceptions.md) to fine-tune your notification preferences, allowing certain notifications to come through even if others are muted. For instance, you can mute all notifications for a channel except for messages sent by a specific user.
