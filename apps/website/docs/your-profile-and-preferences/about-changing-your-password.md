title: About changing your password
---

:::info
Currently, you can't change your Status password.
:::

Your Status password protects both your Status profile and associated Wallet accounts. Scenarios such as switching to another profile or signing transactions require your password.

:::warn
Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password, you may lose access to your Status profile and wallet funds. Remember your Status password, keep it in a safe place, and don't share it with anyone.
:::

:::tip
If you lose your password, check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase][if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase] for more information.
:::

`{/*Unlike the [keys and recovery phrase][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase], the password you set is only valid when your profile is accessible to you. If you haven't used your profile for 30 days, you'll have to restore your profile and wallet accounts and create a new password for them.*/`}`
