title: Create and use additional Status profiles
---

Using your Status profile, you can access and use the different Status app features. Unlike traditional centralized apps which require personal information like a phone number to sign up, Status doesn't ask you for any personal information.

You can create multiple profiles for different purposes. For example, you may want to use different profiles for work, social activities and connecting with families.

If you want to remove a profile, read [Remove a Status profile](../remove-a-status-profile.md).

    If the profile to add is logged in on another device, read [Sync your profile on a new device](../sync-new-device.md) and follow the instructions. Otherwise, [log out of Status](./log-out-of-status.md) and sign in [using your recovery phrase](../getting-started/create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.md) or [Keycard](./create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-keycard.md).

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-settings: **Settings** > :desktop-signout: **Sign out and quit**.
    1. Click **Sign out and quit** again to confirm.
    1. Open the Status app. Click **Cancel** if you're prompted to sign in.
    1. Click :desktop-chevron-down: **Arrow** and then click **Add existing Status user** to sign in.
