title: Back up and secure your recovery phrase
---

Your Status recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase or backup phrase) consists of 12 words that can be used to regenerate your [private key][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase]. If you lose your private key or it is compromised, you lose access to your Status profile and funds forever. For this reason, you must always backup your recovery phrase and keep it safe.

<p class="admonition-title">Screen reader tip</p>
<p>If you're using a screen reader, consider making an audio recording of your recovery phrase or asking someone you trust to do so. For extra security, you can come up with a short story that would include words from your recovery phrase in the right order, and ask someone you trust to record it for you.</p>

- **Keep it safe**

  Use a pen-and-paper backup, writing down your recovery phrase on a piece of paper and saving this paper in a locked safe, at the very least. This is the most common backup method, but it's not the most secure one. Consider using a hardware wallet in addition to your pen-and-paper backup.

- **Avoid digital copies**

  Don't take a screenshot of your recovery phrase and don't save your recovery phrase on your phone, computer or any online services.

- **Never share**

  Do not share the recovery phrase with anyone and be careful about who has access to it.

- **Use a hardware wallet**

  Hardware wallets add an extra layer of security to your recovery phrase. The [Keycard][about-keycard] hardware wallet integrates with the Status app and is compatible with all major cryptocurrencies.

- **Use multiple backups**

  You can combine different backup methods, such as a pen-and-paper backup and a hardware wallet. In addition, you can improve the security of your pen-and-paper backup by dividing up your recovery phrase words and storing them in different places.

Keep your recovery phrase safe and never share it with anyone. Status will never ask you for this information, and anyone who does is trying to steal your profile and wallet funds.
