By design, any blockchain is decentralized and immutable. This means that once something is on a blockchain, it can't be deleted. That includes your wallet: once you get an address and make transactions, there's no way to delete your transaction history.

As the name suggests, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. Deleting all blocks that contain your transactions would mean breaking off the entire chain that follows. While it's impossible to erase your wallet data, you can hide any of the accounts in your Status Wallet.

## Remove an account in your Status Wallet

When you remove an account in your Wallet, you're simply hiding it in the app. The account itself and all of the related data, including your balance and transaction history, stay on the blockchain, but aren't visible to you in the app. You can always [restore your account][import-an-account] later.

Before removing your account, write down and keep its derivation path. You can always restore your account and the crypto it contains using your derivation path or recovery phrase.

## Delete your Status Wallet

:::tip
Blockchains are pseudonymous: unless you sent crypto to your Status Wallet from a centralized crypto exchange, there's no way to trace your address to your real identity.
:::

If you no longer need your Status Wallet, simply [send your leftover crypto to some other wallet address][send-crypto] and uninstall the app. You can always [restore your Wallet][import-an-account] later if you keep your recovery phrase.

\*[pseudonymous]: Sending crypto transactions is the same as posting messages on a forum under a pseudonym. Anyone can see which address each transaction was sent from, but unless you willingly reveal your identity, it's impossible to trace your internet pseudonym (or crypto address) to your real-life identity.
