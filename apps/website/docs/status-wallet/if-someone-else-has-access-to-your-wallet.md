If you think someone else has access to your wallet (for example, you [see transactions in your history that you don't recognize][handle-transactions-you-don-t-recognize]), you should create a new Status profile and transfer your crypto to your new Wallet.

## What to do if someone else has access to your Wallet

### Step 1. Create a new Status profile

Start with creating a new Status profile. You can use multiple profiles at the same time, so you're not losing access to your current profile. For more details on how to create an extra profile, see [Create and use additional Status profiles][create-and-use-additional-status-profiles].

### Step 2. Transfer your remaining crypto to your new Status Wallet
