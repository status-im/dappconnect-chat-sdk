title: Pin a message
---

You can pin important information in group chats so that it doesn't get lost in the message history. For example, you can pin your chat rules, event announcements and FAQ.

Chat members can pin both their own and other members' messages. Message pinning is available in direct messages (DMs), group chats and community channels.

Once you pin a message, it's highlighted and gets a label saying who pinned it.

## Pin a message

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-messages: Messages.
    2. Open the chat you want to pin a message in.
    3. Tap the message you want to pin.
    4. Tap :mobile-pin: **Pin to the chat**.
    To unpin a message, tap it and select :mobile-pin: **Unpin**.

    To view all pinned messages in a group or direct messages chat, open this chat and tap :mobile-pin: **Pinned messages**. If the chat's full, tap the ribbon with the :mobile-pin: **Pin** icon underneath the chat's name.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-chat: **Chat**.
    2. Open the chat you want to pin a message in.
    3. Hover over the message you want to pin.
    4. Click :desktop-pin: **Pin**.
    To unpin a message, hover over it and click :desktop-unpin: **Unpin**.

    To view all pinned messages in a group or DM chat, click :desktop-pin: **N pinned messages** underneath the chat's name. In communities, this will say :desktop-pin: **N**, where N is the number of currently pinned messages.
