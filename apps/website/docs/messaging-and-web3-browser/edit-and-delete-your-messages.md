title: Edit and delete your messages
---

Instead of a centralized server, Status uses a [peer-to-peer network][about-status-messages] to store and distribute messages. When you edit or delete a message, the peer-to-peer network distributes your changes to other users running the Status app.

In some cases, users may still see your original messages, even after you edit or delete them. For example, some users can:

- Run an out-of-date version of the Status app that isn't fully compatible with the peer-to-peer network features.
- Run a custom build of the Status app that doesn't support message editing and deletion by choice.
- Disconnect from the network before receiving your latest changes.

Be careful with what you share, especially in communities. Once published to the network, what you shared may still remain on someone's device even if you choose to delete it later.

### What to expect

- You can edit and delete your Status messages with no time limitations.
- You can only edit text messages. If you want to change a message that contains media content, consider [deleting](#delete-your-messages) and re-sending it.
- Once you edit a message, a permanent note appears next to your message saying it was edited.
- In communities and group chats, you can hide messages you don't want to see with **Delete for me**. Everyone else will still be able to see this message.
- To delete a message for everyone, select **Delete for everyone**. You can only delete your own messages.
