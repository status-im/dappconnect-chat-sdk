If you donâ€™t need a [group chat][understand-group-chats] anymore, you can delete the chat. Once you do that, the chat history and member list are gone forever, with no way to recover this or any other data.

:::info
Only the group chat owner can delete the group. If you're a regular member, consider [leaving the chat][leave-a-group-chat] instead.
