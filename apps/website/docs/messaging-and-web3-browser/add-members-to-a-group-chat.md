title: Add members to a group chat
---

Any member of an existing group chat can add their [Status contacts](./send-a-contact-request.md) to the chat. The maximum number of members is 50. Due to Status's security policy, new joiners won't be able to see the previous message history.

If you want to create a new chat, see [Create a group chat](./create-a-group-chat.md) instead.

    4. Tap :mobile-placeholder: **Add members**. If you're the group chat owner, this will say :mobile-placeholder: **Add / remove members** for you.
