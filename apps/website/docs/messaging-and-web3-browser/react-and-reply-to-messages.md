title: React and reply to messages
---

In Status, you can reply to specific messages and react with emojis.

Replies are useful for when you want to make it clear who you are responding to, as well as receive a faster reply from them. Users whose messages you reply to receive notifications in their [Notification Centre][your-status-notifications-guide].

Reactions are helpful when you want to show others that you saw their message. Users whose messages you react to do not receive any notifications.
