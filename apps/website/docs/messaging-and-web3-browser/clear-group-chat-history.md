title: Clear group chat history
---

Clearing a group chat history clears all messages inside the chat. Only the group chat owner can clear its history for all members.

If you’re not the owner, you’ll clear the chat history just for yourself. Everyone else will still see the full history.

:::info
Once you clear the chat history, it can't be retrieved or restored.
