title: About losing access to a channel
---

There are two types of channels in [Status Communities][about-status-communities]: [public and private][channels-your-quick-start-guide]. When you join a community, you automatically get access to all public channels and private channels for which you meet the [channel requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels].

:::tip
Private channels show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to the channel name.
:::

You can lose access to a channel for two reasons:

- You lose access to the community. Check out [About losing access to a community][about-losing-access-to-a-community] for more information.
- You no longer [hold the required tokens][understand-token-requirements-in-channels] for a private channel. If you lose access to a private channel, you must request to [join the channel][join-a-channel] again.
