title: About losing access to a channel
---

There are two types of channels in [Status Communities](../status-communities/about-status-communities.md): [public and private](../status-communities/channels-your-quick-start-guide.md). When you join a community, you automatically get access to all public channels and private channels for which you meet the [channel requirements](../status-communities/understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md).

:::tip
Private channels show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to the channel name.
:::

You can lose access to a channel for two reasons:

- You lose access to the community. Check out [About losing access to a community](../status-communities/about-losing-access-to-a-community.md) for more information.
- You no longer [hold the required tokens](../status-communities/understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md) for a private channel. If you lose access to a private channel, you must request to [join the channel](../status-communities/join-a-channel.md) again.
